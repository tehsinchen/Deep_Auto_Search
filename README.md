# Deep_Auto_Search


The large number in statistics is essential to validate the statement. However, manual collection is boring and time consuming. In this work, the collection was done by fully automatic operation which combined the projects of https://github.com/tehsinchen/Eff-Unet-Keras for centralization and https://github.com/tehsinchen/Deep_Autofocus for finding the focal plane.



## Demonstration


The process of centralization, recording and saving were speeded up 15 times and 0.8x for finding the focal plane.

## Result


Below are the images that were automatically collected for three hours. Moreover, an additional machine trained with binary classification was included in this project for controlling the quality so that it does not require manual selection of results.
